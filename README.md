The missing child theme of Twenty Twelve that passes all [Theme Unit Test](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test). It provides a better UI based on Twenty Twelve with native CSS variables support for color scheme customization. No need to change the default theme.

## Demo

I haven't setup a demo for it yet, but you can see these sites are using Kai 12:

- [OpenBayes Blog](http://openbayes.blog/)
- [LeanCloud Blog](http://blog.leancloud.cn/)
- [Delicious Blog](http://blog.delicious.com/)

What your site get listed? [Open an issue](https://github.com/sparanoid/kai-12/issues) and tell me.

## Download

You can get the latest version from [official WordPress.org][dl-wp] or from [my own CDN](dl-cdn). The later method you need to upload it via WordPress built-in theme uploader. It has a custom theme update checker to keep it update to date as long as you activate it.

## What's the Difference?

- Better, flat navigation style
- Full dynamic color scheme with WordPress Customizer support based on CSS variables
- [Randomized](https://sparanoid.com/lab/randomized/) powered highlight.js support. Recommended syntax highlight plugin: [Prismatic](https://perishablepress.com/prismatic/).
- Better form, dropdown list style
- `.well` and `.well.dark` class borrowed from Bootstrap
- `.download-btn` - refined download link for posts
- Compatible with Jetpack for WordPress, and many style fixes for it
- Many other minor tweaks
